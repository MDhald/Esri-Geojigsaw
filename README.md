# Esri-Geojigsaw

This application converts a map view into an interactive jigsaw puzzle.

Click [here](http://richiecarmichael.github.io/geojigsaw/index.html) or [here](http://maps.esri.com/rc/puzzle2/index.html) to view the live application.

The application is derived from a JavaScript game developed late last year by the same name. See [here](http://blogs.esri.com/esri/apl/2014/11/18/geojigsaw/) for the corresponding blog posting with links to the live application and source code. This sample was published to demonstrate how to create a dynamic jigsaw puzzle using [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/)'s [D3](http://d3js.org/) graphics library.
